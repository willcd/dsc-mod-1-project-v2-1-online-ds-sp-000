# Data Science, Module 1

## Final Project Submission

* Student name: **William Dougherty**
* Student pace: **self paced**
* Scheduled project review date/time: **Friday April 16, 11:00 AM**
* Instructor name: **Jeff Herman**

## Overview

In this project, I will be exploring data on movies from various sources in order to answer the overall question:

"What type of films are currently doing the best at the box office?"

This is in the context of a hypothetical situation in which I am making recommendations to a large company that is looking to enter the film-making business (i.e. Microsoft) as to what parameters should guide their film development process.

The prompt given by Flatiron is as follows:

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

### 1. Notebook - student.ipynb

This is the main file with all code, visualizations, and explanations.

Overall, I am attempting to examine how two main aspects - production budget, and genre - influence the profitability of a film. I do so by using a few different datasets, as well as a small amount of data requested from an API, to analyze these parameters. I utilized Pandas to organize and manipulate the data, and Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the findings.
